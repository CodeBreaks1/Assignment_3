<p>This is the main repository for the assignment.</p>
<p>It will contain the following environment branches:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Development branch for each user</li>
	<li>Unit testing branch for each user</li>
	<li>Integrated Testing branch</li>
	<li>User Acceptance Test branch</li>
	<li>Final Version Control branch</li>
</ul>

<p>Team members please work <b>only</b> on the repository allocated for you. Please, <b>do not merge</b> your branch with other upper level testing branches <b>until you fully develop your codes and unit test them</b>. After properly developing and unit testing on your development and unit testing branches we can move to the integrated testing branch for "Integration testing". If all will be good, we can move to the UAT environment for final testing. Finally we will release a new version of the project on the final version control branch.</p>
<p>Thank you for attention!</p>
